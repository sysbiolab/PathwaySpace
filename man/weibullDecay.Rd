\title{Constructor of Weibull decay functions}
\usage{
weibullDecay(
  decay = 0.001,
  shape = 1.05,
  pdist = 0.15,
  plot = FALSE,
  demo.signal = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{decay}{A decay factor (in [0,1]). This term indicates how much a
\code{signal} decreases as a function of distance in pathway space. 
For example, at a specific distance defined by the \code{pdist} parameter, 
the signal intensity will be the initial signal multiplied by \code{decay}.}

\item{shape}{A parameter (>=1) of a Weibull function. When \code{shape=1}
the Weibull decay follows an exponential decay. When \code{shape>1}
the function is first convex, then concave with an inflection point.}

\item{pdist}{A distance normalization term (in (0, 1]) at which the signal 
reaches `signal * decay`. This parameter is used to anchor the decay to 
a meaningful distance (see `details`). Also, when \code{pdist = 1}, it will
represent the diameter of the inscribed circle within the coordinate space
of a `PathwaySpace` object.}

\item{plot}{A logical value indicating whether to return a `ggplot` object.}

\item{demo.signal}{A numeric value in `[-Inf, Inf]`, only passed when 
\code{plot = TRUE} to visualize the decay curve with a specific signal 
intensity. The value is ignored by the function constructor, as the decay 
function itself is returned without using an initial signal.}
}
\value{
Returns either a function of the form 
\code{function(x, signal) \{ ... \}} or, if \code{plot = TRUE}, a `ggplot`
object illustrating the decay model.
}
\description{
The `weibullDecay()` constructor either creates a decay function or 
returns a `ggplot` object for visualizing the decay model. It is a utility 
function used internally by \code{\link{circularProjection}} and 
\code{\link{polarProjection}}.
}
\details{
The `weibullDecay()` constructor creates a decay model based on the Weibull 
distribution. It describes how a signal decreases as a function of distance, 
controlled by both a decay rate and a shape parameter.

The decay function is defined as:

\deqn{y = signal \times decay^{\left(\frac{x}{pdist}\right)^{shape}}}

where \eqn{signal} represents the initial intensity, \eqn{decay} controls 
the rate of attenuation, \eqn{x} is a vector of normalized distances,
and \eqn{shape} adjusts the curvature of the decay. When \eqn{shape = 1}, 
the function follows an exponential decay. For \eqn{shape > 1}, the curve 
transitions from convex to concave, exhibiting an inflection point. The 
\eqn{pdist} parameter anchors the model such that:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{y = signal} when \eqn{x = 0}
  \item \eqn{y = signal \times decay} when \eqn{x = pdist}
}
}
\examples{
# Return a decay function
decay_fun <- weibullDecay(decay = 0.5, shape = 2, pdist = 0.4)

# Plot decay model parameters
# weibullDecay(decay = 0.5, shape = 2, pdist = 0.4, plot = TRUE)
