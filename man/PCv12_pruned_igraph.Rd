\title{A pruned and laid out igraph object from Pathway Commons V12}
\format{
igraph
}
\source{
Pathway Commons V12.
}
\usage{
data(PCv12_pruned_igraph)
}
\value{
An igraph object.
}
\description{
This igraph object was created from a 'sif' file available from 
the Pathway Commons V12 (Rodchenkov et al., 2020), which was filtered to 
keep interactions from the following sources: CTD, Recon, HumanCyc, 
DrugBank, MSigDB, DIP, BioGRID, IntAct, BIND, and PhosphoSite. The igraph 
was additionally pruned and laid out by a force-directed algorithm aiming 
signal projection on PathwaySpace's images. Edges with the smallest 
betweenness centrality were pruned using 'backward elimination' and
'forward selection' strategies. The resulting graph represents the 
main connected component with the minimum number of edges.

## Suggestion to vizualize this igraph in R:
library(RGraphSpace)
plotGraphSpace(PCv12_pruned_igraph)
