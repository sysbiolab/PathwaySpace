\usage{
\S4method{polarProjection}{PathwaySpace}(
  ps,
  k = 8,
  pdist = 0.5,
  theta = 180,
  directional = FALSE,
  rescale = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  decay.fun = signalDecay(),
  aggregate.fun = signalAggregation(),
  kns = deprecated()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{A \linkS4class{PathwaySpace} class object.}

\item{k}{A single positive integer determining the k-top signals in the 
signal convolution operation.}

\item{pdist}{A term (in \code{[0, 1]}) determining a distance unit for the
signal decay function. When `pdist = 1` it will represent the diameter of 
the inscribed circle within the pathway space. This distance will affect the
extent over which the convolution operation projects the signal between
source- and destination points.}

\item{theta}{Angle of projection (degrees in \code{(0,360]}).}

\item{directional}{If directional edges are available, this argument can 
be used to orientate the signal projection on directed graphs.}

\item{rescale}{A single logical value indicating whether to rescale 
the signal. If the signal \code{>=0}, then it will be rescaled to 
\code{[0, 1]}; if the signal \code{<=0}, then it will be rescaled to 
\code{[-1, 0]}; and if the signal in \code{(-Inf, +Inf)}, then it will be 
rescaled to \code{[-1, 1]}.}

\item{verbose}{A single logical value specifying to display detailed 
messages (when \code{verbose=TRUE}) or not (when \code{verbose=FALSE}).}

\item{decay.fun}{A signal decay function. Available options include 
'Weibull', 'exponential', and 'linear' (see \code{\link{signalDecay}}).
Users may also define a custom decay model with at least two arguments, 
e.g., \code{function(x, signal) \{ ... \}}, which should returns a vector of  
projected signals of the same length as \code{x}. Additional arguments may  
include any variable available as graph vertex attribute.}

\item{aggregate.fun}{A function used to aggregate the projected signals. 
It must be provided as a unary function, e.g., \code{function(x) { ... }}, 
which should aggregate a vector of signals to a single scalar value. 
Available options include 'mean', 'wmean', 'log.wmean', and 'exp.wmean' 
(See \code{\link{signalAggregation}}).}

\item{kns}{Deprecated from PathwaySpace 1.0.1; use 'k' instead.}
}
\value{
A preprocessed \linkS4class{PathwaySpace} class object.

\description{
\code{polarProjection} implements a convolution algorithm
to project signals across a 2D-coordinate system.

\examples{
# Load a demo igraph
data('gtoy2', package = 'RGraphSpace')

# Create a new PathwaySpace object
ps <- buildPathwaySpace(gtoy2, nrc = 100)
# note: adjust 'nrc' to increase image resolution

# Set '1s' as vertex signal
vertexSignal(ps) <- 1

# Create a 2D-landscape image
ps <- polarProjection(ps)
