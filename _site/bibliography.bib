abstract="The exponential function, and its inverse, the logarithm function, are two of the most fundamental elementary functions in all of mathematics, and in numerical computing. They also turn up hidden inside other important functions, such as the hyperbolic functions, the power function, and in the computation of interest and investment value, and lottery returns, in financial mathematics, a subject that we treat briefly at the end of this chapter.",
